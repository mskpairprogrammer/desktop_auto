**Symptoms:** `Window with 'X' not found`

```

**Solutions:**

1. ✅ Ensure all 4 TradingView windows are open1. Go to your Google Account settings   ```

2. ✅ Run `python list_windows.py` to see available windows

3. ✅ Update `.env` with exact window title keywords## 🤖 AI Analysis Reports

**Symptoms:** Screenshots are black or show wrong content

3. Navigate to Security → App passwords## TradingView Setup

**Solutions:**

   ```- **Key Visible Indicators**: Moving averages, oscillators, volume data, support/resistance

2. ✅ Ensure windows are maximized

3. ✅ Check screen resolution matches click coordinates (1280, 800)- **LuxAlgo Analysis**: Signal quality, price action concepts, overlay indicators (for trend analysis chart)5. Copy the 16-character password to `EMAIL_PASSWORD` in `.env`- `APP_NAME`: Application name (default: "Desktop Auto")

## 💡 Examples



### Example 1: Hourly During Market Hours### Screenshot Settings- Repeat during market hourspython main.py



```bash```bash

# .env

SCHEDULE_ENABLED=TrueSCREENSHOT_DIR=screenshots- Sleep and check every 5 minutes when outside market hours

CAPTURE_START_TIME=09:30

## Configuration Reference

**Windows not found:**

### Scheduling Settings

```bash- Ensure all 4 TradingView windows are open4. **Volumeprofile** - Volume profile analysis### TradingView Automation Features

SCHEDULE_ENABLED=True              # Enable continuous scheduled mode

CAPTURE_START_TIME=09:30           # Market open (24-hour format HH:MM)- Check that window titles contain the expected keywords

CAPTURE_STOP_TIME=16:00            # Market close (24-hour format HH:MM)

CAPTURE_TIMEZONE=US/Eastern        # Timezone for market hours- Run `python list_windows.py` to see all available windows

CAPTURE_INTERVAL_SECONDS=3600      # Run every hour (3600 = 1 hour)

```



**Common intervals:****Screenshots are blank or charts not fully loaded:**The window titles must contain these keywords for the automation to find them.The project includes automated TradingView desktop app interaction:

- `3600` = 1 hour (recommended for market hours)

- `1800` = 30 minutes- Tab 4 already has 15s wait time (longer than others)

- `900` = 15 minutes

- `300` = 5 minutes- Adjust `wait_time` parameter in `main.py` if needed



### Screenshot Settings- Check your internet connection for chart data loading

```bash

SCREENSHOT_DIR=screenshots## Usage1. **Brings TradingView to foreground** (if possible)

SCREENSHOT_NAME_TAB1={symbol}_luxoalgo.png

SCREENSHOT_NAME_TAB2={symbol}_heiken.png**Symbol not updating:**

SCREENSHOT_NAME_TAB3={symbol}_volume_layout.png

SCREENSHOT_NAME_TAB4={symbol}_rvol.png- Script types directly after clicking center of screen2. **Changes stock symbol** using Ctrl+K shortcut

SCREENSHOT_NAME_SYMBOLIK={symbol}_symbolik.png

```- If typing in wrong location, TradingView may have different UI layout



The `{symbol}` placeholder is automatically replaced with each stock symbol.- Verify charts respond to direct typing of symbolRun the automation script:3. **Takes screenshot** of the current chart



### Timing Settings

```bash

WINDOW_SETTLE_DELAY=3.0        # Wait after bringing window to front**Mouse moved to corner / Script cancelled:**```bash4. **Saves screenshot** in organized folders: `screenshots/SYMBOL/`

FOCUS_CLICK_DELAY=1.5          # Wait after clicking to focus

CHART_LOAD_DELAY_TAB1_3=5.0    # Chart load time for tabs 1-3- PyAutoGUI failsafe triggered

CHART_LOAD_DELAY_TAB4=15.0     # Extended load time for volumeprofile

SYMBOLIK_WAIT_DELAY=10.0       # Wait for Symbolik chart to load- Keep mouse away from screen corners during executionpython main.py

```

TRADINGVIEW_ENABLED=True    # Toggle TradingView automation

SYMBOLIK_ENABLED=True       # Toggle Symbolik automation

PERPLEXITY_ENABLED=True     # Toggle AI analysis

SCHEDULE_ENABLED=True       # Toggle scheduled continuous mode1. **Window Detection**: Uses `win32gui` to find TradingView windows by title keywords

```

2. **Window Focus**: Maximizes and brings each window to foreground

## Troubleshooting

3. **Symbol Entry**: Clicks center, types symbol, presses EnterThe script will:- TradingView desktop application must be running

### Windows not found

- Ensure all 4 TradingView windows are open4. **Wait for Load**: Configurable wait times (5s or 15s) for chart rendering

- Check that window titles contain the keywords from `.env`

- Run `python list_windows.py` to see all available windows5. **Screenshot**: Captures full screen and saves with symbol/tab naming1. Wait 3 seconds before starting- The app can be in the background (Alt+Tab will bring it forward)



### Screenshots are blank or wrong timing6. **Multi-Symbol**: Loops through all symbols in `STOCK_SYMBOLS` list

- Adjust wait times in `.env` if charts load slower

- Increase `CHART_LOAD_DELAY_TAB1_3` or `CHART_LOAD_DELAY_TAB4` values2. Switch to the "Trend analysis" window and type the symbol (from `.env`)- Chart should accept direct typing (most TradingView setups do)



### AI Analysis fails## Project Structure

- Verify `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` is set correctly

- Check that `openai` package is installed: `pip install openai`3. Wait 7 seconds for the chart to load- Simple and reliable - no complex shortcuts needed

- Ensure screenshots exist before analysis runs

- Check API key has sufficient credits- `main.py` - Main automation script



### Email alerts not sending- `list_windows.py` - Utility to list TradingView windows4. Take a screenshot and save as `screenshots/SYMBOL/SYMBOL_tab1.png`

- Verify all email settings in `.env` are correct

- For Gmail, use App Password (not regular password)- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

- Ensure SMTP port 587 is not blocked by firewall

- Check spam folder for alerts- `.env` - Configuration file (not committed)5. Switch to each of the other 3 windows and capture screenshots### Safety Features



### Perplexity API errors- `.env.example` - Example environment configuration

- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid API key

- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded, wait and retry- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules6. Save all screenshots without timestamps (overwrites previous runs)

- `500 Server Error`: Perplexity service issue, try again later



### Scheduling issues

- **"Outside market hours" during trading day**: Check `CAPTURE_TIMEZONE` matches your market## License- **Failsafe**: Move mouse to top-left corner to stop automation

- **Not running at expected times**: Verify `CAPTURE_START_TIME` and `CAPTURE_STOP_TIME` are correct

- **pytz errors**: Install with `pip install pytz`

- **Running continuously even outside hours**: Set `SCHEDULE_ENABLED=True` in `.env`
