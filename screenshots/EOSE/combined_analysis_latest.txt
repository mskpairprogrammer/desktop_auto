Trend Change Analysis:

ðŸ“Š Trend Change Probability: 45%
ðŸŽ¯ Confidence Level: HIGH
ðŸš¨ Alert Status: NO ALERT (WARNING)
ðŸ“‹ Summary: Initial analysis reveals extreme overbought conditions with multiple exhaustion signals. -RD formed, Demark 13 exhaustion, MS overbought >250, and price at critical ATM support line. Elliott Wave 4 correction likely in progress. While long-term trend bullish, near-term consolidation/pullback highly probable.

Combined Analysis Results:
========================================
EOSE displays a concerning technical setup despite its strong uptrend. The stock has rallied significantly but is now showing critical exhaustion signals: extreme MS Matrix Mod overbought readings (277.9), a confirmed -RD (Negative Reversal Divergence) on CVD, Demark Sequential "13" exhaustion counts, and price sitting on a key ATM chart line at $16.06. The Elliott Wave structure suggests Wave 4 correction is underway after Wave 3 completed near $20. Low relative volume (0.57) and extreme MA distance (18.51 std devs) further support consolidation/pullback probability. While the long-term trend remains bullish, near-term risk is elevated significantly.
