**MARKET OVERVIEW**

**KEY VISIBLE INDICATORS**

- **Trend Analysis Window (LuxAlgo, 1h):**
  - Recent **Buy signal** after pronounced downtrend.
  - **Price Action:** Structure shows lower lows and a break of structure (BOS); new high-low formation appears to be in development.
  - **Trend ribbon overlays:** Price recently transitioned from under the red (bearish) cloud into/above the green (bullish) support zone.
  - **Oscillator:** QQE and trend matrix turning bullish.

- **Smoothed Heiken Ashi Candles Window (4h):**
  - Heiken Ashi candles remain **solid red** most recently, confirming strong previous bearish momentum, though the last 2-3 candles shrink and "wick" as the move stalls and price bases.
  - **HEMA Trend**: Still downward but with a possible flattening at the latest point.
  - **Divergence indicators:** Recent bullish markers printed near lows (RSI/MOM 3 label visible).
  - **Volume footprint:** Large absorption visible around $0.80â€“$0.90 on volume clustersâ€”potential base/support.

- **Volume Layout Window (1h):**
  - **Money Flow Profile:** Highest volume node and liquidity clustered at $0.87 and $1.06, price rebounding toward higher-value area following large prior selloff.
  - **CVD Divergence Oscillator:** Reads deep negative, but sharp positive green bars just printed, suggest building bullish divergence.
  - **SQZMOM_LB:** Bearish momentum waning, histogram snaps positive on last bar.
  - **MA Distance/Bands:** Price is moving rapidly toward upper bands after a prolonged period below.

- **Volume Profile Window (1h):**
  - **RVOL**: Below 1 (0.70), but last bar shows volume surge. Not at extreme, but confirming fresh activity.
  - **VOLD Ratio:** Recent reading of **-1.09** (mildly negative but shifting less negative), hints at drying sell pressure.
  - **MS (Matrix Mod):** Climbs upward and turns positive today, confirming move out of oversold.
  - **TTOB:** POC migration higher after sharp fall; two new TTOB levels created near current price.

- **Symbolik Workspace Window (4h/long-term):**
  - **ATM Chart Lines:** Price sits just above a major support. $1.10 is a key level overlapping an ATM line.
  - **ATM Elliott Projections/Waves:** Multiple completed sell cycles and countdown 13s near local lows; no new bullish wave confirmed, but prior buy exhaustion count evident.
  - **ATM Pressure Alert:** Most recent period neutralâ€”no high conviction buying or selling pressure alert.
  - **TKT Analysis:** Mixed to improving (recent transition from red to orange/yellow on TKT indicator bars).
  - **TKT Score:** Current level low (18.75) but rising from recent extremely depressed readings.
  - **Demark Sequential:** Recent '13' buy setup triggered at lows.

**CRITICAL SIGNALS**
- **Trend Analysis:** Fresh LuxAlgo Buy signal and short-term market structure break after persistent selloff.
- **Divergence/Volume (Heiken Ashi & Volume Layout):** Bullish divergences visible (RSI/MOM 3), absorption at lows on volume, positive shift in CVD and SQZMOM momentum.
- **Volume Profile:** MS Matrix Mod shifts upward from oversold, TTOB order block at/near current price.
- **Symbolik/DeMark:** Demark Sequential '13' printed at recent low, signifying potential exhaustion of bearish trend. Price is sitting on a major ATM support/resistance line (~$1.10).
- **NO strong +RD/-RD or extreme MS overbought visible at current levels; action is a relief from oversold, not reversal from overbought.**

**TRADING DECISION**

**HOLD / SPECULATIVE BUY**  
Rationale:  
Multiple indicators highlight a likely **short-term bottom and relief rally**:  
- Fresh buy signals and bullish divergences post-exhaustion  
- Price holding at/above key support (ATM line, high volume node, TTOB)  
- Sequential '13' at lows (classic reversal/exhaustion setup)  
However, medium- and long-term structure is still bearish with no completed higher-highs, and overall context is volatile and weak. Entry could be considered for tactical, short-term upside with tight stops. Long-term investors should wait for more confirmation (higher-highs, retest and hold of supports).

**TREND CHANGE EVALUATION**

- **Intermediate trend**: Reversal potential is visible, but full uptrend confirmation is not present; this is best described as a bounce in a bearish regime.
- **Immediate probability of sustained trend change is low**, but short-term reversal (relief rally) is moderately likely.
- **Key levels for confirmation**: Sustained close above $1.24â€“$1.34 for stronger bullish reversal thesis.
