**KEY VISIBLE INDICATORS**

- **Trend Analysis (Chart 1, 1H):**  
  - *LuxAlgo Signals:* Multiple recent ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù and ‚ÄúSell‚Äù markers, no fresh Strong Buy/Sell.  
  - *Price Action Concepts:* Structure labeling of Higher Highs (HH), Lower Highs (LH), Lower Lows (LL), and Higher Lows (HL).  
  - *Overlays:* Clearly defined resistance (red zones above), current price approaching overhead resistance.  
  - *Oscillators/Indicators:* LuxOscillator (bullish), QQE trend showing a recent ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù, Kalman Trend Oscillator in bullish territory.

- **Smoothed Heiken Ashi Candles (Chart 2, 4H):**  
  - *Heiken Ashi Candles:* Currently red (bearish trend persisted), but some latest candles display decreasing body size, signaling waning bearish momentum.  
  - *HEMA Trend:* Still downward but flattening.  
  - *Divergence Indicators:* Yellow RSI MOM (Momentum) marker below most recent low (possible early bullish divergence).  
  - *Volume Footprint:* Significant volume accumulation below price between 11.00‚Äì11.20; suggests potential support forming.

- **Volume Layout (Chart 3, 1H):**  
  - *Money Flow Profile:* Price trading above a high-volume node, suggesting previous accumulation at lows around 11.05‚Äì11.20.  
  - *CVD Divergence:* No explicit +RD/-RD (positive/negative reversal divergence) signals visible. Net CVD still negative, but some recent positive bars.  
  - *SQZMOM_LB:* Squeeze gone, histogram flipping green (momentum turning bullish).  
  - *MA Distance/StdDev Bands:* Price rebounded from a prior low/extreme band, currently approaching ‚Äúzero line‚Äù in MA distance.

- **Volume Profile (Chart 4, 1H):**  
  - *RVOL:* Below 1, so relative volume is light, NOT confirming strong trend extension.  
  - *VOLD Ratio:* Slightly negative, more selling pressure on recent bars, but not extreme.  
  - *MS (Matrix Mod):* Last visible bars are not at overbought/oversold extremes.  
  - *TTOB Order Blocks:* Buy and Sell sweeps mixed, nearest zone just below at 11.30‚Äì11.36 and above at 11.60‚Äì11.65, providing short-term S/R.

- **Symbolik Workspace (Chart 5, 4H/long-term):**  
  - *ATM Chart Lines:* Current price is between two significant ATM chart lines (10.34 below, 19.21 above), with 11.52 roughly in the middle of low-congestion zone.  
  - *ATM Elliott Wave/Projections:* Current count mild, last significant #13 signal near recent lows, suggesting exhaustion of the prior downtrend.  
  - *ATM Pressure Alert:* Not visibly active at present level.  
  - *TKT Analysis:* TKT Score hovering around 19 (low conviction).  
  - *Variable Aggressive Sequential (Demark):* Last #13 signal occurred recently, which can indicate a potential reversal exhaustion.

**CRITICAL SIGNALS**
- **No new Strong Buy/Sell on LuxAlgo**, but multiple minor buy signals clustered around recent low.
- **RSI Momentum Flag** and flattening HEMA on 4H: possible short-term bullish divergence, increased buying off latest low.
- **SQZMOM_LB** has flipped green, suggesting momentum is swinging positive; CVD still weak but improving.
- **No clear +RD or -RD divergence** present on CVD Divergence Oscillator.
- **No MS Matrix Mod overbought/oversold conditions** visible.
- **Demark Sequential #13** (exhaustion) showed up near local lows. This is historically a high-probability reversal area.
- **Price near support cluster (11.00‚Äì11.20)**, overhead resistance at 11.60‚Äì12.00.

---

**TRADING DECISION**  
**HOLD with slight bullish bias.**  
- There is evidence of **momentum shifting positively** (SQZMOM green, QQE/oscillator ‚ÄúBuy,‚Äù accumulation at lows, and Demark #13 near the bottom).  
- However, **volume is not expanding (RVOL < 1)**, and **overhead resistance is heavy** (11.60+), indicating this is likely a recovery bounce, **not a confirmed trend reversal**.  
- Best action: If long, can continue to hold with a tight stop below 11.10. New entries could wait for a pullback or a confirmed breakout over 11.60+ on volume.

---

**TREND CHANGE EVALUATION**  
Price is **recovering from a local bottom**, with several **early signals of trend improvement** but **not enough confirmation for a strong long position**. Watch for follow-through buying, a close above 11.60 with volume, and more convincing institutional accumulation to confirm true reversal.
