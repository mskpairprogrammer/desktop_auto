**KEY VISIBLE INDICATORS**

- **Trend Analysis (Chart 1, 1H):**
  - **LuxAlgo signals:** Shows previous strong sell signals with a series of lower highs (LH) and lower lows (LL). Most recent structure hints at potential stabilization.
  - **Price Action Concepts:** LH/LL sequence, possible formation of higher low (HL) at recent pivot, indicating a pause in the downtrend.
  - **Overlays:** Envelope bands and order blocks suggest resistance between $8.01â€“$8.50, support in the $6.50â€“$7.00 area.
  - **Oscillator Matrix:** Currently near midrange; no strong momentum divergence, but upward inflection noted.
  - **QQE:** Previously gave a buy, then immediate sell; currently flat to weak.

- **Smoothed Heiken Ashi & Volume Footprint (Chart 2, 4H):**
  - **Heiken Ashi Candles:** Consecutive strong red candles, indicating sustained bearish pressure.
  - **HEMA Trend:** Below price and still sloping down, confirming ongoing bearish trend.
  - **Volume Footprint:** Visible absorption at lower levels ($7.00 vicinity) with large buy volumes, but insufficient to reverse higher timeframe trend.
  - **No clear bullish divergence or exhaustion visible.**

- **Volume Layout (Chart 3, 1H):**
  - **Money Flow Profile:** Major distribution between $8.01â€“$8.50 (red nodes), with signs of accumulation at $6.99â€“$6.34.
  - **CVD Divergence Oscillator:** Remains deeply negative (-51M), showing aggressive selling dominance. No recent +RD or -RD signal found.
  - **SQZMOM_LB:** Slight bullish momentum increase, but still below zero (no squeeze fire).
  - **MA Distance with StdDev Bands:** Deep negative reading, approaching -20, indicating price far below averageâ€”potential mean reversion zone.

- **Volume Profile (Chart 4, 1H):**
  - **RVOL:** Below 1 (0.68), indicating volume is lower than averageâ€”moves are less likely to sustain.
  - **VOLD Ratio:** Negative (-1.09), reinforcing the ongoing selling pressure.
  - **MS (Matrix Mod):** Slightly recovering from oversold conditions (-233), but not yet indicating overbought/reversal zone.
  - **TTOB Order Blocks:** Multiple bearish sweep signals near $7.75â€“$7.50 zone with POC now compressing towards $7.31.

- **Symbolik Workspace (Chart 5, 4H):**
  - **ATM Chart Lines:** Current price ($7.46) is sitting just above a significant ATM support line (~$6.47) but below prior resistance lines at $8.15, $9.70, $10.87.
  - **ATM Elliott Wave:** Final waves of a downward sequenceâ€”recently completed a wave 5, with potential early stabilization.
  - **ATM Pressure Alert:** No fresh bullish pressure alert visible.
  - **Variable Aggressive Sequential:** No new 9 or 13 signals shown at the current price level.
  - **TKT Score:** Oscillating near neutral-to-lowâ€”no strong opportunity signal.

---

**CRITICAL SIGNALS**
- **No new +RD or -RD divergence** detected in CVD or related oscillators.
- **MS (Matrix Mod) indicates recently oversold conditions**, now slowly recovering.
- **ATM Chart Line alignment:** Price is hovering above a major support ($6.47); breakdown would be highly bearish.
- **Bearish volume sweeps and VOLD ratio** showing distribution remains in control.
- **No new Demark Sequential 9 or 13** signals suggest price exhaustion; prior 13s marked tops, but none appear at current lows.
- **Strong resistance** between $8.01â€“$8.50 verified by both Money Flow Profile and price action.

---

**TRADING DECISION**

**HOLD / CAUTIOUS WATCH**  
- Not a buy yet: There is no confirmed reversal or strong bullish divergence.  
- Not a sell: The stock is approaching or sitting on a major multi-system support zone ($6.47â€“$7.00), and momentum indicators are deeply stretched.
- Only consider aggressive long entries **IF** you see a clean intraday reclaim above $7.75 with volume, or new bullish divergences on CVD/momentum.  
- Wait for confirmation: A break below $6.47 would invalidate support and turn this into a high-conviction sell signal.

**TREND CHANGE EVALUATION**

Downward momentum is decelerating but **not reversed**. Several oversold signals (MS Matrix Mod, MA distance) are presenting, but neither volume nor buy-side divergences confirm a bottom. Watch for support holding above $6.47 and look for strengthening order flow (e.g., reducing selling on VOLD ratio, positive CVD reversal, buy-side volume absorption) **before expecting a full trend change**.
